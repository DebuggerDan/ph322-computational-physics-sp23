    "This project focuses on digesting the complex, highly data-verbose nature of electroencephography (EEG) data into readable, visually represented formats (e.g. pretty graphs, visual insights, etc.), for a given end-user of at least a familiarity of numerical analysis to get meaningful insight from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electroencephography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique used to record electrical brain activity. Electrodes are placed on the scalp of the brain that measure microcurrents (uVrms).\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily, we will be focusing on categorizing the brain waves as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alpha (8-13 Hz) - Alert but relaxed; e.g., eyes are closed or meditation is occuring.\n",
    "2. Beta (13-30 Hz) - Awake and alert; e.g.,\n",
    "eyes are open and actively thinking.\n",
    "3. Gamma (30-100 Hz) - Higher mental activity, including perception, problem solving, and consciousness (fun fact: lots of \"EEG\" toys are based on capturing this frequency range as its high enough to be easily captured by cheap sensors)\n",
    "4. Delta (0.5-4 Hz) - Deep sleep\n",
    "5. Theta (4-8 Hz) - which occurs usually during light sleep, deep meditation, and also REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using graphical analysis we can categorize these brain waves and see how they change over time. Using such data, we can take a glimpse into brain activity through what activities / state of mind these brain waves may represent, e.g. deep concentrating, or relaxation over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) to categorize these bands for easy viewing."

    "For EEG data, I will be using a [OpenBCI Cyton](https://docs.openbci.com/Cyton/CytonLanding/) board, which is a low-cost, open-source, programmable, 8-channel EEG board. The board is connected to a computer via USB, and the data is streamed to the computer via a Python script. The data is then processed and analyzed using Python libraries such as [pyOpenBCI](https://github.com/openbci-archive/pyOpenBCI) and [PyQtGraph](https://www.pyqtgraph.org/).\n",
